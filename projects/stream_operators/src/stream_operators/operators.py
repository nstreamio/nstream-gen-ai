Generate a Python function that implements a streaming operator for calculating the 
{operation} of a sequence of values. The function should take two arguments: 
an accumulator (acc) and a new value (x). It should return a tuple containing the 
updated accumulator and the result of the calculation. The accumulator should be 
initialized appropriately if it is empty. The function should be efficient, numerically 
stable, and able to handle large sequences without significant performance degradation 
or errors. For numerical stability, please use a well-known algorithm such as 
Welfordâ€™s online algorithm to avoid issues with precision and accumulation of rounding 
errors. Ensure that the function does not modify the input accumulator directly.

Specifically, the function should:
- Take two arguments: acc (accumulator) and x (new value)
- Return a tuple containing: (updated_acc, result)
- Initialize the accumulator appropriately if it is empty
- Perform the specified calculation using the accumulator and new value
- Return the updated accumulator and result

Please write a Python function that meets these requirements for the following calculation:
{operation}
